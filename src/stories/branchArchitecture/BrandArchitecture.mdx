Brand architecture
==================

Introduction
------------

The brand architecture system is designed to help Queensland Government departments and other entities deliver a consistent look and feel to their digital design system.

An outcome of this consistent approach is that Queenslanders may better understand how government services are related to the Queensland Government.

### The ‘Solar system’ approach


The brand architecture is organised with an 'outside-in' approach, where entities are structured around public perception. That said, it's not to be confused with or replace the internal organisational structure.

The Queensland Government Brand (master brand) is the ‘Sun’ at the centre. Closely aligned brands to the ‘Sun’ will have a stronger connection and more commonalities with the Queensland Government brand.

Less closely aligned brands to the ‘Sun’ will share some commonalities with the Government brand but be able to add their own elements to cater for a specific audience or messaging.

Master brand
------------

### Criteria

All Queensland Government communications must follow the requirements of the master-brand category unless approval has been granted to use another brand.

### Rationale

Master brand represents the Queensland Government. Websites that use the master brand have a strong visual connection to the Queensland Government which enables the people of Queensland and stakeholders to easily identity Queensland Government services, initiatives and activities.

It is important for the public to easily recognise the work of government departments and their agencies. This shows the information is official, trusted and comes from the government.

**Master brand sites generally feature:**

*   general public information
*   whole of government policy or strategic directions
*   general staff information
*   programs and initiatives
*   services
*   events
*   state-wide projects
*   apps and tools for the general public.

### Master brand examples

*   qld.gov.au
*   smartjobs
*   ForGov
*   Queensland Open Data portal
*   Queensland Publications portal

* * *

Sub-brand
---------

### Criteria

Represents an official agency or department of the Queensland Government including all divisions and branches within that department.

### Rationale

Sub-brands are government departments and agencies whose online presence demonstrates a strong tie to the Queensland Government, and ensures transparency and accountability.

Their content benefits from the authority that the Queensland Government brand provides so they share the most commonalities with the master brand.

### Sub-brand examples

*   Queensland Health
*   Department of education
*   Department of Resources
*   Queensland Police Service

* * *

Co-brand
--------

### Criteria

Co-brands the category for most statutory bodies created and operated by the Queensland Government. Co-branding is also used for joint federal or state joint initiative.

**Statutory bodies that often fall into the co-brand category are:**

*   courts
*   governing bodies
*   trusts
*   boards and
*   commercialised business units.

### Rationale

Co-branded websites benefit from the authority of Queensland Government, but their brands are often tailored to reach a more specific audience and so are granted more flexibility.

Because they are still required to demonstrate accountability and Queensland Government ownership, they must still adhere to many of the master brand requirements and display the Queensland Government Coat of Arms as their primary identifier.

### Co-brand examples

*   Breast Screen Queensland
*   National Bowel Cancer Screening Program
*   Gold Coast Hospital and Health Service
*   Legal aid Queensland

* * *

Endorsed
--------

### Criteria

Endorsed sites represents a program, initiative or advertising, communication and marketing campaign that has Government Advertising and Communication Committee (GACC) approval.

Campaigns that do not follow the GACC approval must seek approval for a brand exemption from DPC.

### Rationale

Endorsed sites provide a specific service and/or need to communicate with a specific target audience and and have clear communication objectives. These sites establish trust and credibility through association with the government and actively raise awareness and profile of the Queensland Government.

These sites must display the Coat of Arms but may have a varying degree of detail required compared to the master brand guidelines.

### Endorsed examples

*   Quit HQ
*   Advance Queensland
*   Unite and Recover
*   Vape Truths

* * *

Stand alone
-----------

### Criteria

The stand-alone category is for statutory bodies created and operated by the Queensland Government that:

*   provide independent advice or
*   are a business or corporation or
*   need to appear separate from the Queensland Government for legislative reasons.

**Statutory bodies that often fall into the stand alone category:**

*   Tribunals
*   Commissions
*   Advisory
*   Reviewers
*   Government Corporations
*   Charity Foundations

### Rationale

Stand alone brands share the least in common with the Queensland Government master brand. They are often independent entities that need a separate identity for legislative or strategic reasons.

### Stand alone examples

*   Mental Health Tribunal
*   Integrity Commission
*   Queensland Ombudsman
