Release 2.0.0
=============

Release notes:
--------------

**Release date:  14 April 2022**

Welcome to the first Queensland Government Design System update.

We’re excited to announce our first major update of the design system Figma file. Although we’ve made several updates, this is our first major new release.

In this release our components are aligned to our most resent code releases. Each new release of this Figma file will coincide with major new site launches and code updates.

**Component updates**
---------------------

As we update components you may find some content changes occur or overrides are reset to default. Colour will also often reset to default values so you may need to apply your colour styles again using themer.

**Recommended**

Before updating to the latest version of our design system we always recommend you make a back up of your original project file.

**Component removals**
----------------------

Components that have been removed will have a ❌ symbol. You’ll be able to find them in our archive folder until the next major release.

Most of the components we’re removing are still being tested and developed. You’ll be able to find most of them in our new Design System Development Branch.

**Component replacements**
--------------------------

Any components that have been completely replaced with new version have a ⚠️ symbol. You’ll be able to find them in our archive folder until the next major release.

**Please note:** you can choose to leave archived components in your designs but they won’t be supported in any future updates.

**Support**
