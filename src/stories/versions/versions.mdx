**22 August 2024**: We released v1.8.0 of the design system

The v1.8.0 release of the design system introduces new features like long breadcrumb support with an overflow menu for better usability.  It also includes improvements to the footer with enhanced visibility of the Acknowledgement of Country, as well as updates to promo panel layouts. Several bug fixes have also been made to address issues like hover state text colors, form error messages, and filtering checkboxes in the main navigation.
