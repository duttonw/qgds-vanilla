Developing
==========

Overview
--------

The work presented on this website, linked Figma file and our code repositories has been designed by Queensland Health (QH) as part of their Digital Transformation Program.

The Queensland Government Customer and Digital Group in Department of Communities, Housing and Digital Economy is partnering with QH to explore how this could be used as the foundation for a whole-of-government Design System.

We're consulting government agency stakeholders to inform this and to gain feedback and understand agency requirements and perspectives on a whole-of-government Design System. This includes sharing artefacts such as:

*   this design Figma file
*   showcases
*   design and technical reference groups
*   1:1 agency engagement.

More detailed information about how to develop with the Design System will be released with the first public beta version of the Design System.

Currently available resources
-----------------------------

*   [Github code repository](https://github.com/Qld-Health-Online-Team/design-system) - Our Github code repos are now public and available for your use. Note while providing access to our codebase we are not personally supporting any users of the codebase.

Resources that will be made available in the future
---------------------------------------------------

*   Squiz Matrix template - Qld Health has a Squiz Matrix template configured to allow the creation of sites, the usage of page templates and the adding of Design Systems to the page as Squiz components
*   NPM package - An NPM package as constructed by Qld Health using the current alpha version of the Design System is available. This NPM package will be rebuilt as part of the first public beta version of the Design System
