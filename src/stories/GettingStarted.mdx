### Please note

The work presented on this website, linked Figma file and our code repositories has been designed by Queensland Health (QH) as part of their Digital Transformation Program. This has not been approved for whole-of-government application.

If you are thinking of using this design system for your site before the official public release of the Queensland Government Design System, please email [qgdesignsystem@qld.gov.au](mailto:qgdesignsystem@qld.gov.au) so they can add you to their communications list for future updates.

The Queensland Government Customer and Digital Group in Department of Transport and Main Roads (TMR) is partnering with Queensland Health (QH) to explore how this could be used as the foundation for a whole-of-government design system.

We are consulting government agency stakeholders to gain feedback on existing artefacts, and to understand agency requirements and perspectives on a whole-of-government design system. Consultation channels include:

*   1:1 agency engagement
*   design and technical reference groups
*   communities of practice
*   showcase events.

More detailed information about how to get started with the design system will be released with the first public beta version of the design system.
