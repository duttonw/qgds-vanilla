Brand requirements
==================

These guidelines provide a whole-of-government standard for consistent application of the branding across all government websites.

Overview
--------

The Queensland Government, like any organisation, needs to project a unified and consistent visual identity both internally and externally. These guidelines provide a whole-of-government standard for consistent application of the branding across all government websites.

Brand and style patterns refer to elements in the Design System that create a specific aesthetic connected to the brand identity. Examples of brand elements include, but aren't limited to:

*   colours
*   typography
*   logos
*   imagery
*   iconography.

This section is known as the brand foundations because they build the base of the Design System. They're the fundamental building blocks that form the basis of the Design Systems appearance.

Background
----------

As happens in many large and complex organisations over time, there is inconsistent application of Queensland Government brand identity and visual identity elements on internal and external communications and in digital products and services. This can lead to:

*   customer and stakeholder confusion
*   lack of defined rules and guidelines
*   expression of organisation structure instead of public perceptions
*   incorrect attribution of Government.

The lack of a defined brand architecture has made it difficult for product and service owners to identify where they fit, as new entities and the associated brands and websites have been created. The resulting proliferation, complexity and inconsistency creates customer and stakeholder confusion and is impacting:

*   attribution of Queensland Government and the department
*   the correct application of brand identity elements.

Solution
--------

The solution to this problem is defining a comprehensive brand architecture and related brand guidelines.

*   The [brand architecture](./?path=/docs/0-1-brand-foundations-brand-architecture--overview) is a system that organises brands and services to help Queenslanders understand how they're related to the Queensland Government.
*   The [brand guidelines](/?path=/docs/0-1-brand-foundations-brand-guidelines--overview) detail how to apply the brand architecture to your site, including how the header, footer, site name and logos should be applied.
