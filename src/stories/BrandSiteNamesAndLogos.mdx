Site names and logos
====================

Overview
--------

Most Queensland Government websites aren't permitted their own logo and can only be identified through the use of either a ‘Name identifier or Name style’. The key aspect of these is that they don't include any imagery or graphics and are written only in the official government font Meta.

*   **Name Identifiers** are most commonly used for Government Departments and core services.
*   **Name styles** are used for used major projects, internal campaigns and statutory bodies.
*   **Unique Logos** are generally reserved for large scale public campaigns or government initiatives and can only be created with approval from the Department of Premier and Cabinet.

Name identifiers
----------------

Generally, name identifiers are the name of the sub-brand written in the Meta typeface. Name identifiers are only permitted to be used on websites and internal collateral.

Sub-brands identifiers are kept simple because their names are often subject to changes that occur due restructures in government.

Name styles
-----------

A namestyle can be used as an alternative to a logo to help individualise your brand. Your namestyle must be built in the corporate font Meta.

Namestyles can't include any graphics however colours and font weights can be adjusted.

A namestyle may also be a shortened version of an entities name, for example ‘Metro North Hospital and Health Service’ could use the namestyle ‘Metro North Health’.
