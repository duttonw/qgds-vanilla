Digital services policy and standard
====================================

The Design System has been tailored to assist Government departments with the design, delivery, and management of public-facing digital services in conjunction with the digital services policy and standards.

The digital services policy
---------------------------

The digital services policy sets out best practice principles for Queensland Government agencies to design and deliver public-facing digital services that are consistent, secure and simple for users.

It's part of the Queensland Government Enterprise Architecture policy series and replaces Websites policy (IS26).

The digital service standard
----------------------------

The digital service standard provides 13 criteria that must be met when developing or significantly altering government digital information, products, and services. Ie. digital services must meet all 13 criteria.

Using the Design System assists agencies in meeting many of the criteria in the digital service standard. In particular, criteria 6 of the standard – Build consistent and responsive design and criteria 9 Make digital services accessible.
