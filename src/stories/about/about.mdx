A Design System is a collection of design guidelines, components, and tools that are used to create a consistent and cohesive user experience across multiple digital products and services. It serves as a foundation for design and development teams to work from, providing a common language and set of best practices for creating user-centered products.

Design systems are becoming increasingly important for government organisations such as the Queensland Government, as they help to ensure that digital products and services are accessible, inclusive, and meet the needs of all users. They also help to improve the efficiency and scalability of design and development teams, as they can re-use components and patterns rather than starting from scratch each time.

In addition, Design Systems can also help to improve the overall user experience of government services, making them more intuitive and easier to use. This can lead to increased satisfaction and trust among citizens, as well as better compliance and adoption of government services.
