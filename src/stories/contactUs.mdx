### Keep in touch about the Queensland Government Design System (QGDS)

The work presented on this website, linked Figma file and code repositories have been designed by Queensland Health (QH) as part of the Digital Transformation Program.

If you are thinking of using this design system for your site before the official public release of a whole-of-government design system, please email [qgdesignsystem@qld.gov.au](mailto:qgdesignsystem@qld.gov.au) so you can be added to the communications list for future updates, as we work towards the Queensland Government Design System.
