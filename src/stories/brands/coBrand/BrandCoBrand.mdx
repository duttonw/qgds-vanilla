Co-brand
========


Overview
--------

Co-brand website logos are created by locking up the the Queensland Government crest with the site name or brand logo or namestyle. They can incorporate unique brand colours.

Desktop pattern
---------------

On desktop the side-stacked minimum sized CoA has been used as the lock up for with co-brand site names because it allows for the best use of vertical and horizontal height in the header.

The style is based on a pattern implemented by the South Australian government who have a very similar government logo. This lock up of the CoA and Site name is only permissible on Government websites.

Co-brand sites may also use namestyle for their site name, or in some cases, a logo that has been approved by the Department of Premier and Cabinet.

Where possible, logos and namestyles should not appear more dominant than the Queensland Government CoA.

Co-brands follow a similar layout on mobile and tables to the master brand. The key difference is that the site name or logo is positioned in a section below the CoA. This still gives the CoA precedence while keeping the site name clear and accessible.
