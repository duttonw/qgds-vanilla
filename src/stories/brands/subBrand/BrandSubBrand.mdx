Sub-brand
=========

On this page
------------

Overview
--------

Represents an official agency or department of the Qld Government including all divisions and branches within that department.

Sub brand website titles are created by locking up the the Queensland Government COA with the site name.

They’re the least flexible design and must use Queensland Government colours and can only use [name identifiers.](site-names-and-logos.html)

*   Brand attribution pattern on headers and footers (below)
*   Core styles
*   [Typography](https://www.design-system.health.qld.gov.au/styles/typography)
*   [Iconography](https://www.design-system.health.qld.gov.au/styles/iconography)
*   [Grids](https://www.design-system.health.qld.gov.au/styles/layout-foundations) and [spacing](https://www.design-system.health.qld.gov.au/styles/spacing)

### Recommended

[Design system default colours](https://www.design-system.health.qld.gov.au/styles/colour)

If your sub brand site is offering services for the general public such like renewing a drivers license, that benefits from a strong visual connection to the Qld Government, it is recommend that you use the default colours as this will mean your site will match qld.gov.au.

### Flexible

Unique graphic devices and patterns can be used on sub-brand sites.

### Examples of sub brand

*   health.qld.gov.au
*   education.qld.gov.au
*   rdmw.qld.gov.au
*   qgso.qld.gov.au
*   ambulance.qld.gov.au

Coat of Arms and site name guidelines
-------------------------------------

The guidelines below detail the placement of the Queensland Government Coat of Arms on Master brand sites. It also details  what options master brand sites have for site names.

### Desktop pattern

On desktop the side-stacked minimum sized CoA has been used as the lock up with sub-brand site names because it allows for the best use of vertical and horizontal height in the header.

This lock up of the CoA and Site name is only permissible on Government websites.

<img src={Desktop1}  />

Example

<img src={Desktop2}  />

On desktop, longer site names run over 2 lines.

<img src={Desktop3}  />

Name identifier with words **Department of** smaller than the rest.

#### Mandatory requirements

*   Must use the minimum size website logo
*   Site names must be in Name identifier format
*   Site names must be no larger than 1.24 rem (20px)

### Tablet pattern

Sub-brands follow a similar layout on mobile and tables to the master brand. The key difference is that the site name is positioned in a section below the CoA. This still gives the CoA precedence while keeping the site name clear and accessible.
