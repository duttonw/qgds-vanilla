# Linked Columns

May also be known as: ``Lists`` ``li`` ``ul`` ``ol``


# Overview

Linked Lists are a collection of items that are ordered in a sequence. They are used to group related items together and provide a clear visual hierarchy. Linked Lists are commonly used to display navigation menus, lists of items, or other types of content that need to be displayed in a structured way.

## Linked Columns

These buttons are designed to be the most prominent and visually distinct on a page or within a user interface. Primary buttons are typically used to indicate the primary action that a user is intended to take, such as submitting a form, initiating a purchase, or creating a new account.

Example

<Canvas additionalActions={[{ title: 'Linked List', layout: 'centered' }]}
        of={linkedColumns.Default} />
