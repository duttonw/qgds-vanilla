Overview
--------

The card component is used to provide a brief summary of content or a task, often with a link to more detail.

Cards are frequently displayed alongside other cards and group related content or tasks.

Cards are used to organise information related to a single topic. Cards can contain multiple elements, such as images, links, actions, text, tags and more.

There are 3 primary types of cards current available in our Design System:

*   No action (Non-clickable cards)
*   Single action
*   Multiple action.

Each of these cards has a number of variations available such as colour, call to actions, tags and image.

Example

*   ### No action card

The text used here is card description text. It should be no more than 2-3 lines long.

*   ### [Single action card](javascript:void(0))

The text used here is card description text. It should be no more than 2-3 lines long.

*   ### [Multi action card](javascript:void(0))

The text used here is card description text. It should be no more than 2-3 lines long.

* * *

*   [Card link one](javascript:void(0))
*   [Card link two](javascript:void(0))
*   [Card link three](javascript:void(0))

Usage guidelines
----------------

### Success status icon Indicates a success state When to use cards

*   Cards are better suited when users browse for information than when they search, this is because card layouts are less scannable than lists (Laubheimer, 2016)
*   Cards are an excellent choice for dashboard applications and for social or aggregation sites that display a variety of content types at the same time on the same page (Laubheimer, 2016)

### Status cancel icon Cancel icon or warning icon When not to use cards

*   Avoid using cards instead of table rows for organised information
*   If the reader needs to read the content in order, use a list or simple paragraphs with headings
*   Cards are also a poor choice when users need to [compare between multiple options](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/explicit-differences "https://www.nngroup.com/articles/explicit-differences/"), since cards often aren't structured in a predictable way from item to item (Nielson, 2013)
*   You have many sections with little information in each—use a [table](tables.html)
*   to link to content lower down on the page, consider [in-page navigation](in-page-navigation.html)

### Information status icon Indicates that information is required or toggles a tooltip How to use cards

#### Do

*   **Display cards together in a grid or vertical list**
*   **Keep to one concept per card:** You can use multiple elements such as images, text, links and icons but they should all constitute one thought or action
*   **Consider and choose text and visual elements carefully:** Test your cards with minimal content and only add additional content or graphics where they give needed context to the user
*   **Keep text short and concise:** According to Google's Material Design guidelines, cards should "display a small amount of information at a glance, usually no more than 2-3 lines of text" (Material Design, n.d.)

#### Don't

*   Overload with information as the card links to content that contains more detail
*   Use multiple different styles of cards in the same section. This can create conflicting visual messages, and cause visually cluttered page
*   Don’t include inline links. A card should be a singular link or provide a limited set of actions

Single action cards
-------------------

Single action cards display content and actions on a single topic.

These are the default cards and should always have some form of interactive element or action.  Single action cards have only one primary link or action. Only single actions cards have changes in their hover state. For single action cards the hit area for the card wraps the entire card.

### Single action cards are available in 5 varieties

*   Default: default card used to organise information related to a single topic.
*   Leading icon: a variant where an icon is placed on left of the content.
*   Stacked icon: a variant of the default card where an icon is placed at the top of the card.
*   Arrow card: a variant of the default card where a trailing arrow icon is placed after the heading.
*   Image card: a variant of the default card using an image.

Example

*   ### [Default card](javascript:void(0);)

The text used here is card description text. It should be no more than 2-3 lines long.

### [Card with arrow](javascript:void(0);)

The text used here is card description text. It should be no more than 2-3 lines long.

### [Card with stacked icon](javascript:void(0);)

The text used here is card description text. It should be no more than 2-3 lines long.

### [Card with leading icon](javascript:void(0);)

The text used here is card description text. It should be no more than 2-3 lines long.

*   ### [Card with image and footer](javascript:void(0);)

The text used here is card description text. It should be no more than 2-3 lines long.

### [Card with footer](javascript:void(0);)

The text used here is card description text. It should be no more than 2-3 lines long.

* * *

This is card footer text

Usage guidelines
----------------

### Success status icon Indicates a success state When to use

Use single action cards when a card links to a single piece of content. Single action cards are useful to present a collection of related groups of content, like articles or sections of a website. Single action cards are often used as a preview of the full content available such as for an article or blog post.

### Status cancel icon Cancel icon or warning icon When not to use

*   Alone with as an individual call to action. Use a [button](buttons.html "#") instead
*   When you need to have multiple links within the card element use a multi-action card instead
*   As the only form of navigation, while cards can be a useful navigation tool, relying solely on cards for navigation can be limiting. It's important to provide other forms of navigation to help users find what they're looking for.

Multi-action cards
------------------

Multiple action cards contain more than one link.

Their design is different to single action cards because they need to accommodate for different hover, focus states and keyboard navigation.

Multiple action cards have no shadows on desktop, but they do have a subtle shadow on mobile. Multiple action cards are commonly used for, news cards and facility cards.

### Multi action cards are available in 4 varieties

*   Default Default: card used to organise information related to a single topic.
*   Leading icon: A variant of the default card where an icon is placed on left of the content. This is a good option for when cards need to be placed in a vertical list or where vertical height is limited.
*   Stacked icon: A variant of the default card where an icon is placed at the top of the card.
*   Image card: A variant of the default card using an image.

Example

*   ### [Default card](javascript:void(0);)

The text used here is card description text. It should be no more than 2-3 lines long.

* * *

*   Card link one
*   [Card link two](javascript:void(0);)

Feature cards
-------------

A variant where the media sits on the right or left of the content. Feature cards are multiple interaction cards with the image aligned to the left or right. Feature cards are designed to promote content and use the most real estate on a screen. Feature cards can be used within sets of card groups to highlight the latest content or most important content. Feature cards have a different image layout when they span the full width of a container on desktop screens.

Usage guidelines
----------------

### Success status icon Indicates a success state When to use

Use multi-action cards when a card contains multiple options or actions related to a single concept or task. However, it's important to keep in mind that too many links can be overwhelming and confusing for users, so it's important to design cards with a clear hierarchy of information and actions.

### Status cancel icon Cancel icon or warning icon When not to use

*   If there is only one action, use a single action card instead
*   If you need to present the user with more then three actions or links

### Information status icon Indicates that information is required or toggles a tooltip How to use

### Do

*   Display cards together in a grid or vertical list
*   One concept per card: you can use multiple elements such as images, text, links and icons but they should all constitute one thought or action
*   Consider and choose text and visual elements carefully: test your cards with minimal content and only add additional content or graphics where they give needed context to the user
*   Keep text short and concise: According to Google's Material Design guidelines, cards should "display a small amount of information at a glance, usually no more than 2-3 lines of text" (Material Design, n.d.)

### Don't

*   Overload with information as the card links to content that contains more detail
*   Use multiple different styles of cards in the same section. This can create conflicting visual messages, and cause visually cluttered page
*   Don’t include inline links. A card should be a singular link or provide a limited set of actions

No action cards
---------------

No action cards are simple content containers designed to group similar content and assist the user to scan content on a page.

No action cards have no interactive elements and don't have shadows or hover states. No action cards can help to break up content on a page, this content should always be self contained.

### No action cards are available in 4 varieties

*   Default: default card used to organise information related to a single topic.
*   Leading icon: a variant of the default card where an icon is placed on left of the content.
*   Stacked icon: a variant where an icon is placed at the top of the card.
*   Image card: a variant using an image.

Example

*   ### Default no action card

The text used here is card description text. It should be no more than 2-3 lines long.

### No action card with stacked icon

The text used here is card description text. It should be no more than 2-3 lines long.

### No action with leading icon

The text used here is card description text. It should be no more than 2-3 lines long.

*   ### No action with image

The text used here is card description text. It should be no more than 2-3 lines long.

### No action with image and footer

The text used here is card description text. It should be no more than 2-3 lines long.

No action cards guidelines
--------------------------

### Success status icon Indicates a success state When to use

Use this style of cards if you want to share a discrete piece of information to your audience that doesn't include a link. For instance, you can use this style of card to share a quote, statistic, definition or visual aid.

### Status cancel icon Cancel icon or warning icon When not to use

*   For large sections of text
*   To draw attention to text within content use a [callout](callouts.html) instead
*   If your card contains a link or multiple links

Card anatomy
------------

All cards follow a similar anatomy and structure and are available in 4 colours.

### Colour

Unlike other components where the colour is determined by their content containers a cards colour is controlled independently from the background. Cards can use any of the 5 primary background colours as their base colour. The outer border colour however will respond to the background.

Example

Theme

*    White
*    Light
*    Alt
*    Dark
*    Dark-alt

*   ### [Default (no class)](javascript:void(0))

This card has no colour modifying class applied.

*   ### [Light](javascript:void(0))

This card has the class **qld\_\_card--light** applied.

*   ### [Alt](javascript:void(0))

This card has the class **qld\_\_card--alt** applied.

*   ### [Dark](javascript:void(0))

This card has the class **qld\_\_card--dark** applied.

*   ### [Dark alt](javascript:void(0))

This card has the class **qld\_\_card--dark-alt** applied.

### Card structure

A card is container for a few short, related pieces of information. It roughly resembles a playing card in size and shape, and is intended as a linked, short representation of a conceptual unit (Nielsen Norman Group, 2016). All cards share anatomy that is comprised of 3 main sections, rich-media, card Inner and card footer.

The **rich media** section houses card images, icons or video thumbnails. Cards images use fixed image ratio of 16:9 and the Qld responsive image class.

The **section houses the card title, description and in news cards a date.**

**The card footer is used to guide users to the call to action or to tags that may support the article content.**

<img src={CardStructure} alt="Card structure" />

### **Card elevation**

**On desktop, cards have a shadow on hover. This is reversed on mobile. The subtle shadow on mobile helps to indicate that the card is an interactive component.**

<img src={Elevation} alt="Card elevation" />

### **Icons and images**

**Using visual elements (such as images or icons) in cards allows for different content to stand out and provide additional context. It helps users visualise different pieces of information and quickly distinguish between content to find information easily (Digital NSW n.d.).**

**In our Design System you can choose to use custom iconography in the rich-media section.**

**Any visual elements should:**

*   **re-enforce the content to the user**
*   **be easily identified**
*   **not be used for decorative purposes only.**

* * *

Research and rationale
----------------------

The design of our components started with [DTA](https://gold.designsystemau.org/components/card "https://gold.designsystemau.org/components/card/") as a foundation, functionality and features were added after an extensive review of other Design Systems and best practice research. Our visual designs were heavily influenced by Victoria’s ripple Design System (State Government of Victoria, 2022) and Google’s [Material Design](https://m2.material.io/components/cards#anatomy "https://m2.material.io/components/cards#anatomy") (Material Deign, n.d.) and [Nielson Norman UI-Component Definition](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/cards-component "https://www.nngroup.com/articles/cards-component/") (Laubheimer, 2016).

Some of the key areas we investigated when designing our cards was the use of curved edges, behaviour of single action vs multiple action cards, hover states and elevation styles, integrating action buttons and designing cards for articles and new page layouts.

### Curved edges

We've used curved edges in our card design to help create a softer, more approachable look for cards. The curved edge creates a stronger visual distinction between cards and other design elements on a page, making it easier for users to identify and interact with cards.

Furthermore, Plasq designer, Keith Lang in his [article](https://designmodo.com/rounded-corners/) on rounded corners offers a quote from Professor Jürg Nänni an authority on visual cognition who states

A rectangle with sharp edges takes indeed a little bit more cognitive visible effort than for example an ellipse of the same size. Our “fovea-eye” is even faster in recording a circle. Edges involve additional neuronal image tools. The process is therefore slowed down.”

Professor Nänni is saying that rounded corners have been found to take less cognitive load to see than it does to see sharp-cornered ones and are more computationally efficient for the human brain.

You may also notice that image cards have an intern curved edge on the bottom right corner. This was an intentional design choice to help visually connect the image with the description. It also creates a very subtle visual design similar to that of a speech bubble whilst giving our Design System cards their own unique flare.

### Multi-action behaviour

Best practice and research conducted by the [DTA](https://gold.designsystemau.org/components/card/rationale/) indicated that when a card had a single link the whole region of the card must be clickable and however what we encountered was need from our users to have cards that included multiple clickable regions for links like news articles that included clickable tags or facility cards that had multiple navigational options (Digital Transformation Agency, 2018).

Our solution was to a create a new variety of cards which we tabled multi-action. The behaviour of these cards included having different hover, focus states and keyboard navigation. Unlike single action cards, only the actions within the card have a hover state and the entire card no longer has an elevation on hover.

### Card actions, tags and buttons

Material Design guidelines by Google recommend limiting the number of actions in a card to no more than four or five (Material Design, n.d.). And Microsoft fluent suggest a best practice, include 1-3 actions (Microsoft, 2021). This is based on the principle that "less is more" when it comes to user interface design, and that too many options can lead to decision paralysis and user frustration.

Similarly, the Human Interface Guidelines recommend limiting the number of actions in a card to a small, manageable set that is essential to the user's task. They suggest grouping related actions together and presenting them in a clear and organised way to help users quickly find and access the functionality they need (Apple Inc., n.d.).

For these reasons we have based our card action designs around 3 modified CTA style links that can include an icon and are placed in a list within the footer of the card. These are known as supplemental actions or secondary actions. Research from both our comparative review and material design also suggested that the best placement for these was on the bottom left of the card this placement supported by both material design and the original DTA card structure. As an alternative to the card actions, users can also include clickable or clickable tags in the footer area. These were included to support the best practice approach to the design of new article cards which we established in our comparative review of card designs.

If a user wants to include buttons in their card it's important that these are also placed in the footer. If a secondary and primary action button are included the best practice research as well as our comparative review suggests that in small windows, the primary action button should be placed at the bottom right while the secondary action appears on the left.

However if the action is destructive, rather than reducing friction and making it easy for the user to execute the action, destructive actions should introduce friction to make the user pause before continuing, and alternative approaches should be sort for these situations such as requiring the the user to confirm the action or take an extra step such as writing the word DELETE to ensure they really want to take a destructive action (Carlson B, n.d).

<img src={Stack} />

### Arrow links

One of the new styles we added to our cards was what are called Arrow links. In our Design System we have developed a consistent approach to the use of arrows and chevrons. In all cases where an arrow is used this indicates a link that takes you from page to page. Because this is a common function of a card and was also a common pattern found on cards in our comparative review, we added a trailing arrow icon to our default action cards as a new option for users.

### Elevation

Our card elevation patterns and style take direction from [material design](https://m2.material.io/components/cards#behavior "https://m2.material.io/components/cards#behavior") but use our Design System elevation styles. Material design suggests having 2 distinct forms of elevation for mobile and desktop.

On desktop, cards by default have no resting elevation rather using an outline to indicate the card component. These cards only have an elevation on hover. On mobile, cards have a small default elevation which helps reintroduce visual depth as a [signifier](http://jnd.org/dn.mss/signifiers_not_affordances.html "http://jnd.org/dn.mss/signifiers_not_affordances.html") of click-ability (Laubheimer P 2016).

Accessible card requirements
----------------------------

Keep these considerations in mind if you are modifying the Design System or creating a custom component.

### Best practice

#### Card lists

To improve accessibly, use unordered lists and list items. Each card should be contained in an `<li>` element within a `<ul>` element. This allows screen readers to read the items in the card group and enables shortcuts between list items.

#### Card links

Having an anchor tag wrapping these contents has the benefit of having a large click area. A user is able to click anywhere in this card and view the full article or blog post.

However this can cause difficulties for screen readers. When a screen reader user focuses on this anchor tag, the _entire_ contents of the card are read out. This can be a frustrating experience, particularly when there is a lot of content inside the cards. Furthermore when there is a large amount of cards (wrapped by anchors) on a single page, the links landmark menu of screen readers can get extremely convoluted.

Given this, the alternative is to have a single anchor tag inside the card, and have the hit area of this anchor tag wrap the card. This approach yields the benefits of having a large click area, but avoids issues for screen readers.

### WCAG guidelines

#### 1.1.1 Non-Text Content

Provide alternatives for any non-text content so it can be changed into other forms, like large text, braille, speech, symbols, or simpler language (W3C, 2018). This includes images, icons, etc. contained in the card. Use alt tags for images.

Background image example:

`<div class="qld__responsive-media-img--bg" role="img" aria-label="Description of image"></div>`

Standard image element example:

`<img src="card_image.jpg" alt="Description of image">`

#### 1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence

When a sequence affects the meaning, it must be determined programmatically or available in text (W3C, 2018). This means the order of elements within the card should make sense when read by a screen reader. Make sure to use the appropriate heading level for your page to ensure card headings are in the correct order.

#### 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)

The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 (W3C, 2018). Check text-colour to background-colour contrast.

### 2.1.1 Keyboard

All content should be operable through a keyboard interface, without needing specific timings for individual keystrokes (W3C, 2018). This includes all interactive elements within the card.

#### 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context)

The purpose of each link should be clear from the link text or its context (W3C, 2018). If links are present, their purpose should be understandable.
